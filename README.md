My name is Christopher Panlasigui.

## Education
I am currently a student at CSULA (California State University, Los Angeles), working on getting my Master's in Electrical Engineering with a focus on telecommunications.
I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona in May 2023 and I majored in Electrical Engineering. I graduated magna cum laude and was part of the honors society, Tau Beta Pi.

## Experience
I worked for SCE (Southern California Edison) as a wireless engineering intern for 1 year (May 2022 to May 2023).
I worked for LAUSD (Los Angeles Unified School District) as an associate project engineer 1 since September 2023.

## Hobbies/Projects
I have a few ideas for projects that I want to build, but (given my work and school schedule) I have elected to postpone them until I am able to have a few things:
- time
- money to fund my projects
- a place to store and create all my projects

Outside of that, I like to play video games (primarily Monster Hunter World) and cook.
